  Instructions

  I have defined 3 methods that you need to complete. I have written some comments in each
  method to get you headed in the right direction.

  Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck, but consult with your partner first!

def practice_one
  # Create an array

  # Add three elements to the end of it.

  # Add one element to the front of it.

  # Now print out only the second element

end

def practice_two
  # I've created an array for you
  array = ["Ruby", "BEWD", "Learning"]

  # Loop through the array and print out each element with the phrase "Is Cool!" after it.
  # For example, the first thing printed out would be "Ruby Is Cool!"
  # Here is some starter code:
  array.each do |item|

  end
end

def practice_three
  # Heads up! This one combines a few concepts you've learned and is more challenging!
  # Feel free to ask for help! Don't give up!
  # I've created an array for you
  array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  # Your goal is to loop through this array, and print out only the even numbers
end

# You don't need to change this down here, it just calls the methods you are working on
